# uRTS
Grand Scale Strategy done right!


Hello! Welcome to the project! Let's get you started on installing the Unreal engine and working on uRTS with us!

Step one is to get the Unreal engine launcher. It can be found at https://www.unrealengine.com/register. Follow all the instructions included with the registration and installation process. 

Step two is to get the proper version of the engine loaded up! Once in the launcher, go to the Unreal Engine tab at the top left, and then select Library from the left menu. Next, at the top of the page, look for 4.15.0. If it isn't there, click on "add versions" and select 4.15.0 or the latest version of 4.15 and follow the installation instructions.

Great! Now you need to get the project started! You should already have a Github Account (if you don't, make one). The easiest way to do this is with GitBash, available here - https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/releases/latest (this is a direct download link). After you have it, follow these instructions to clone the project - https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/. 

Once you have your clone, you can go back to the unreal launcher, start up the 4.15 version, and then browse for the repository that you just made. The project should launch, and then any changes made in the editor will also show up in the repository. You may wish to clone the project on your PC using the tools in Unreal in order to avoid corrupting your copy. 

Now that you have what you need, I will leave it up to you to find the best way to handle your version of the git desktop or gitbash using the tutorials that you can find all over the web. 

For other commands, never let the cheatsheet get too far away! - https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf
