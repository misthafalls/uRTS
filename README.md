Grand Scale Strategy done right!


Hello! Welcome to the project! Let's get you started on installing the Unreal engine and working on the project with us!.

Step one is to get the Unreal engine launcher. It can be found at https://www.unrealengine.com/register. Follow all the instructions included with the registration and installation process. 

Step two is to get the proper version of the engine loaded up! Once in the launcher, go to the Unreal Engine tab at the top left, and then select Library from the left menu. Next, at the top of the page, look for 4.15.0. If it isn't there, click on "add versions" and select 4.15.0 or the latest version of 4.15 and follow the installation instructions.

Great! Now you need to get the project started! You should already have a Github Account (if you don't, make one). The easiest way to do this is with GitBash, available here - https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/releases/latest (this is a direct download link).
